🚨 HelpLink – Occupation-Based Emergency Response App
💡 Problem

In emergencies, time is critical. Often, people with the right skills are nearby — a doctor, an electrician, a firefighter, or even a trained volunteer — but they don’t know help is needed. As a result, valuable minutes are lost before professional services arrive.

🚀 Our Solution

HelpLink is a mobile-first app that connects people in need with skilled individuals nearby, based on location + occupation.

During sign-up, users enter their occupation/skills (e.g., doctor, nurse, electrician, police, volunteer).

When an emergency is triggered, the app sends instant alerts to relevant nearby people.

Those who can help respond with a single tap, and their live location is shared with the requester.

This creates a community-powered safety net where immediate help is always within reach.

✨ Key Features (Planned)

📍 Location-based emergency detection

👩‍⚕️ Occupation/skill-based filtering

🔔 Instant push notifications to nearby helpers

🗺️ Live map of responders

✅ One-tap "I can help" response

📌 Example Scenarios

A person faints in public → nearby doctors/nurses are notified.

A fire breaks out → firefighters/electricians nearby are alerted.

A road accident occurs → volunteers/police are notified for quick action.
